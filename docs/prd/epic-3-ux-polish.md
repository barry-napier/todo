# Epic 3: User Experience Polish

## Epic Overview
Add responsive design, accessibility features, error handling, loading states, and performance optimizations to create a polished, production-ready application.

## Goals
- Ensure application works flawlessly across all devices
- Meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Provide smooth, delightful user interactions
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- Optimize performance for instant response times

## Requirements Addressed
- **FR8:** Interface adapts responsively to mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **NFR3:** Application works offline and syncs when connection returns
- **NFR4:** Interface follows accessibility standards
- **NFR5:** Data remains available even if browser cache is cleared
- **NFR6:** Application uses modern web standards

## User Stories

### Story 3.1: Responsive Design Implementation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Responsive Breakpoints
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Base: 0-767px */
/* Tablet: 768px-1023px */
/* Desktop: 1024px+ */
/* Large: 1440px+ */
```

### Accessibility Implementation
```typescript
// Focus Management Hook
useKeyboardNavigation()
useFocusTrap()
useAnnouncements()

// ARIA Patterns
role="list"
role="listitem"
aria-label=""
aria-describedby=""
aria-live="polite"
```

### Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint: < 1s
- Time to Interactive: < 2s
- Lighthouse Score: > 95
- Bundle Size: < 200KB gzipped
- 60fps animations

### Error States
```typescript
interface ErrorState {
  type: 'storage' | 'network' | 'validation' | 'unknown';
  message: string;
  recoverable: boolean;
  retryAction?: () => void;
}
```

## UI/UX Specifications

### Animation Timings
- Micro interactions: 150-200ms
- Page transitions: 300-400ms
- Loading spinners: After 200ms delay
- Skeleton screens: Immediate

### Touch Gestures (Mobile)
- Swipe right: Mark complete
- Swipe left: Show delete option
- Long press: Enter edit mode
- Pull down: Refresh (if applicable)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N`: New todo
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`: Save edit
- `Delete/Backspace`: Delete selected
- `Space`: Toggle selected
- `Arrow keys`: Navigate list

### Loading States
1. **Initial Load:** Skeleton screen
2. **Adding Todo:** Optimistic add + save indicator
3. **Editing:** Inline with auto-save indicator
4. **Deleting:** Fade out animation
5. **Sync:** Background indicator
