# Personal Todo Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a fast, reliable personal todo management system that eliminates scattered task tracking
- Build a distraction-free interface that encourages daily task completion
- Establish a foundation for personal productivity that can grow with future needs
- Demonstrate modern web development practices using Next.js, Tailwind 4, and shadcn/ui

### Background Context
Current personal task management relies on inefficient methods like scattered notes, memory, or overly complex enterprise tools. This creates friction in daily productivity workflows and leads to forgotten or duplicated tasks. 

The solution addresses this by providing a purpose-built, fast, and always-accessible digital todo system that focuses purely on personal productivity without collaboration overhead or unnecessary features that complicate the core workflow.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, minimalist interface that gets out of the way of productivity. Emphasizes speed of task entry and clear visual distinction between pending and completed tasks. Follows modern design patterns while maintaining simplicity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Quick Entry**: Primary interaction is fast text input with enter-to-submit
- **One-Click Actions**: Complete/edit/delete with single click/tap
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear visual states for pending, completed, and editing modes
- **Keyboard-First**: Full keyboard navigation support for power users

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard**: Primary todo list view with add functionality
- **Empty State**: Helpful guidance when no todos exist
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions during data operations

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
- Keyboard navigation for all functions
- Screen reader compatible with semantic HTML
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements

### Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic using shadcn/ui design system. Neutral color palette focused on readability and reduced visual fatigue. Subtle animations that enhance usability without distraction.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive design that works seamlessly across phone, tablet, and desktop environments.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all application code, optimized for simplicity and solo development.

### Service Architecture
Next.js full-stack application with API routes for data persistence, deployed as a unified application.

### Testing Requirements
Unit testing for core functionality with focus on data persistence and UI interactions. Integration testing for API routes. Manual testing for user workflows.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use TypeScript for type safety across frontend and backend
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Use Next.js App Router (latest) for optimal performance
- Integrate shadcn/ui components following their design patterns
- Implement proper SEO and meta tags even for personal use
- Use environment variables for any configuration
