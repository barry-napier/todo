## Information Architecture (IA)

### Site Map / Screen Inventory

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Todo Dashboard] --> B[Empty State]
    A --> C[Todo List View]
    A --> D[Add Todo Input]
    C --> E[Individual Todo Item]
    E --> F[Edit Mode]
    E --> G[Complete/Incomplete State]
    E --> H[Delete Action]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Single-page application with no traditional navigation menu

**Secondary Navigation:** Not applicable - single view application

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Not needed - single page application focused on immediate task management

## User Flows

### Add New Todo Flow

**User Goal:** Quickly capture a new task

**Entry Points:** Main input field at top of todo list

**Success Criteria:** Task appears in list immediately and input is ready for next task

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User on Dashboard] --> B[Focus on Input Field]
    B --> C[Type Todo Text]
    C --> D{Press Enter or Click Add?}
    D -->|Enter| E[Submit Todo]
    D -->|Click Add| E
    E --> F[Validate Input]
    F --> G{Valid?}
    G -->|No| H[Show Error Message]
    G -->|Yes| I[Add to List]
    H --> C
    I --> J[Clear Input Field]
    J --> K[Focus Input for Next]
    K --> L[Success - Ready for Next Todo]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Empty text input shows inline validation message
- Network failures save locally and sync when available
- Long text wraps gracefully in display

**Notes:** Flow optimized for continuous task entry with immediate feedback

### Complete/Edit/Delete Todo Flow

**User Goal:** Manage existing tasks efficiently

**Entry Points:** Any todo item in the list

**Success Criteria:** Changes take effect immediately with clear visual feedback

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Views Todo List] --> B{User Action?}
    B -->|Click Checkbox| C[Toggle Completion]
    B -->|Click Text| D[Enter Edit Mode]
    B -->|Click Delete| E[Delete Todo]
    
    C --> F[Update Visual State]
    F --> G[Persist Change]
    G --> H[Show Feedback]
    
    D --> I[Show Text Input]
    I --> J{Save or Cancel?}
    J -->|Enter/Save| K[Update Text]
    J -->|Escape/Cancel| L[Revert to Original]
    K --> G
    L --> A
    
    E --> M[Remove from List]
    M --> G
    
    H --> A
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Edit mode cancels when clicking outside todo item
- Delete action is immediate (no confirmation for simplicity)
- Persistence failures show retry option with local backup

**Notes:** All actions designed for single-click efficiency with immediate visual feedback

## Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:** Will be created using shadcn/ui component documentation and examples

### Key Screen Layouts

#### Main Todo Dashboard

**Purpose:** Primary interface for all todo management activities

**Key Elements:**
- Application title/header (minimal)
- Add todo input field (prominent placement)
- Todo list container (scrollable)
- Empty state illustration and guidance
- Status indicators (count of active/completed)

**Interaction Notes:** Input field auto-focuses on page load. Enter key in input adds todo and refocuses input for continuous entry.

**Design File Reference:** Based on shadcn/ui form and list components

#### Individual Todo Item Layout

**Purpose:** Display and interact with single todo items

**Key Elements:**
- Checkbox for completion toggle (left aligned)
- Todo text content (expandable width)
- Edit mode text input (inline replacement)
- Delete action (subtle, right aligned)
- Visual completion state (strikethrough, opacity)

**Interaction Notes:** Hover reveals delete action. Click on text enters edit mode. Checkbox provides immediate visual feedback.

**Design File Reference:** Custom component using shadcn/ui checkbox and input components

## Component Library / Design System

**Design System Approach:** Leverage shadcn/ui component library with minimal customization for consistency and rapid development

### Core Components

#### TodoInput Component

**States:** Empty, typing, submitting, error

**Usage Guidelines:** Always prominent at top of interface, auto-focus on page load, clear after successful submission

#### TodoItem Component

**Purpose:** Display and interact with individual todos

**Variants:** Pending, completed, editing

**States:** Default, hover, editing, loading, error

**Usage Guidelines:** Consistent spacing in list, clear visual hierarchy, immediate feedback on state changes

#### TodoList Component

**Purpose:** Container for all todo items with empty state

**Variants:** Populated list, empty state

**States:** Loading, populated, empty, error

**Usage Guidelines:** Scrollable container, consistent item spacing, smooth animations for add/remove

## Branding & Style Guide

### Visual Identity

**Brand Guidelines:** Clean, minimal productivity tool aesthetic using shadcn/ui default theme with subtle customizations

### Color Palette

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Primary | #0f172a | Text, borders, primary actions |
| Secondary | #64748b | Muted text, secondary elements |
| Accent | #3b82f6 | Focus states, active elements |
| Success | #22c55e | Completed todos, positive feedback |
| Warning | #f59e0b | Validation messages, cautions |
| Error | #ef4444 | Error states, destructive actions |
| Neutral | #f8fafc, #e2e8f0, #cbd5e1 | Backgrounds, borders, subtle elements |

### Typography

#### Font Families
- **Primary:** Inter (system font fallback)
- **Secondary:** System UI stack
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono (for any code/technical content)

#### Type Scale
| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| H1 | 2rem | 600 | 1.2 |
| H2 | 1.5rem | 500 | 1.3 |
| H3 | 1.25rem | 500 | 1.4 |
| Body | 1rem | 400 | 1.5 |
| Small | 0.875rem | 400 | 1.4 |

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Lucide React (included with shadcn/ui)

**Usage Guidelines:** Use minimal icons for actions (add, edit, delete, check). Maintain 16px or 20px sizes for consistency. Use outline style for consistency.

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** CSS Grid and Flexbox with Tailwind utilities

**Spacing Scale:** Tailwind's default spacing scale (0.25rem increments) with generous whitespace for clarity

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with comprehensive implementation

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: Clear 2px outline with high contrast color (#3b82f6) 
- Text sizing: Scalable to 200% without horizontal scroll
- High contrast mode: Enhanced visual states for users with vision needs
- Completion states: Strong visual distinction beyond opacity (icon + strikethrough + color)

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full arrow key navigation within todo list, home/end for list boundaries
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML with comprehensive ARIA labels
- Touch targets: Verified 44px minimum with 8px spacing between targets
- Keyboard shortcuts: n=new todo, d=delete focused item, space=toggle completion
- Focus management: Proper focus restoration after edit cancellation

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive labels for all icons and status indicators
- Heading structure: Logical H1-H6 hierarchy with skip links
- Form labels: Explicit labeling with clear instructions and validation messages
- Live regions: aria-live="polite" announcements for dynamic updates
- Error messaging: Plain language with specific recovery instructions

**Technical Implementation:**
- ARIA live region for status announcements: "Todo added", "Todo completed", "Todo deleted"
- Focus trap implementation for edit mode with escape key support
- Roving tabindex for efficient list navigation
- Reduced motion support via CSS prefers-reduced-motion queries
- Semantic HTML structure: main, section, article elements for screen readers

### Testing Strategy

- Automated testing with axe-core integration in test suite
- Manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) on all user flows
- Keyboard-only navigation testing through complete workflows
- High contrast mode testing in Windows and browser settings  
- Touch target verification on actual mobile devices
- Cognitive accessibility testing with simplified language validation

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, small laptops |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, desktop monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors, ultrawide displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Single column on mobile/tablet, centered content with max-width on desktop

**Navigation Changes:** Not applicable - single page application

**Content Priority:** Input field remains prominent at all sizes, todo list optimizes for readability

**Interaction Changes:** Touch-friendly targets on mobile, hover states on desktop, keyboard shortcuts displayed on larger screens

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance usability without causing distraction. Fast transitions (200-300ms) that feel responsive. Reduced motion preference respected via CSS prefers-reduced-motion.

### Key Animations

- **Todo Add:** Gentle slide-in from top with fade (300ms, ease-out) plus focus shift to new item
- **Todo Complete:** Smooth strikethrough animation with opacity change (200ms, ease-in-out) plus ARIA announcement  
- **Todo Delete:** Quick slide-out to right with fade (250ms, ease-in) plus focus restoration to next item
- **Edit Mode:** Smooth transition to input field with focus highlight (150ms, ease-out) plus screen reader mode announcement
- **Hover States:** Subtle scale or shadow change (100ms, ease-out) with reduced motion fallbacks
- **Loading States:** Accessible skeleton animation with descriptive text (1s, ease-in-out)
- **Focus Indicators:** Instant appearance with 2px high-contrast outline
- **Error States:** Attention-drawing shake animation (200ms) with ARIA alert announcement

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Under 1 second for initial paint, under 2 seconds for interactive
- **Interaction Response:** Under 100ms for all user actions including accessibility announcements
- **Animation FPS:** 60 FPS for all transitions with prefers-reduced-motion support

### Design Strategies

Optimize for performance through efficient component design, minimal re-renders using React.memo strategically, and efficient shadcn/ui component usage. Prioritize critical rendering path for todo list display. Implement virtual scrolling if todo list exceeds 100 items. Use React.Suspense for non-critical features.
