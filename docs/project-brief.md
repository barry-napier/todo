# Project Brief: Personal Todo Application

**Session Date:** September 2, 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** User

## Executive Summary

A personal productivity application built with Next.js that provides simple, effective todo list management for individual users. The application solves the problem of scattered task tracking by offering a clean, fast, and reliable digital todo system accessible from any device.

## Problem Statement

Current task management approaches are either too complex (enterprise tools with unnecessary features) or too simple (paper lists that can't be accessed everywhere). Users need a straightforward digital todo system that is always available, fast to use, and doesn't get in the way of actual productivity.

The problem impacts daily workflow efficiency and can lead to forgotten tasks, duplicated efforts, or the overhead of managing multiple task tracking systems across different contexts.

## Proposed Solution

A clean, responsive web application that provides essential todo functionality without bloat. The solution focuses on speed of entry, clear visual organization, and reliable persistence. Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance and user experience.

Key differentiators:
- Optimized for personal use (no team collaboration overhead)
- Fast task entry and editing
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Reliable local and cloud persistence

## Target Users

**Primary User Segment: Individual Productivity Users**
- Demographics: Working professionals, students, and organized individuals
- Current behaviors: Use mix of paper lists, notes apps, or complex project tools
- Specific needs: Quick task capture, clear visual organization, reliable access
- Goals: Improved personal productivity and reduced mental overhead

## Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Objectives:**
- Create a personal productivity tool that is actually used daily
- Demonstrate modern web development practices with Next.js stack
- Build a foundation for potential future productivity features

**User Success Metrics:**
- Daily active usage for task management
- Tasks completed through the application
- Preference over other todo solutions

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- Task creation rate: Multiple tasks added per session
- Task completion rate: >70% of created tasks marked complete
- Session frequency: Daily or near-daily usage

## MVP Scope

**Core Features (Must Have):**
- **Add Todo:** Quick text entry for new tasks
- **View Todos:** Clean list display of all tasks
- **Mark Complete:** Toggle completion status
- **Edit Todo:** Modify existing task text
- **Delete Todo:** Remove tasks from list
- **Persistence:** Save tasks between sessions

**Out of Scope for MVP:**
- User authentication (single user initially)
- Categories or tags
- Due dates or scheduling
- Collaboration features
- Mobile app (responsive web only)
- Advanced filtering or search

**MVP Success Criteria:**
Successfully manage daily personal tasks with reliable persistence and responsive interface.

## Post-MVP Vision

**Phase 2 Features:**
- Categories/tags for organization
- Due dates and basic scheduling
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Basic analytics (completed tasks over time)

**Long-term Vision:**
Foundation for comprehensive personal productivity suite with potential for calendar integration, note-taking, and goal tracking.

**Expansion Opportunities:**
- Mobile app development
- Multi-user/family features
- Integration with calendar applications
- Productivity analytics and insights

## Technical Considerations

**Platform Requirements:**
- **Target Platforms:** Web (responsive design)
- **Browser/OS Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Performance Requirements:** Fast page loads (<2s), instant interactions

**Technology Preferences:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (latest), React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (integrated)
- **Database:** Simple persistence (localStorage + optional cloud backup)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui components
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Vercel (optimal for Next.js)

**Architecture Considerations:**
- **Repository Structure:** Single repository (simple project)
- **Service Architecture:** Monolithic Next.js application
- **Integration Requirements:** Minimal (self-contained)
- **Security/Compliance:** Basic (no sensitive data initially)

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints:**
- **Budget:** Personal project (free/low-cost services preferred)
- **Timeline:** Learning-focused (no strict deadlines)
- **Resources:** Solo development with AI assistance
- **Technical:** Modern web standards, accessibility basics

**Key Assumptions:**
- Single user initially (no multi-user complexity)
- Web-first approach (no native mobile requirement)
- Simple data model (text-based tasks)
- Modern browser support sufficient

## Risks & Open Questions

**Key Risks:**
- **Over-engineering:** Risk of adding unnecessary complexity to simple concept
- **Technology Learning Curve:** First time with Tailwind 4 or latest Next.js features

**Open Questions:**
- Data persistence strategy (client-side vs server-side)
- Offline capability requirements
- Future scalability considerations

**Areas Needing Further Research:**
- Tailwind 4 implementation best practices
- shadcn/ui integration patterns with Next.js latest
- Simple database options for personal projects

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Review and approve this project brief
2. Create comprehensive PRD with detailed feature specifications
3. Design UI/UX specification with shadcn/ui integration
4. Develop technical architecture using specified stack
