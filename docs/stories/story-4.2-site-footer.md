# Story 4.2: Site Footer with Repository Link

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Dark Mode & Theme System
**Status:** âœ… Ready for Review
**Estimate:** 1-2 hours
**Assignee:** Developer

## Story

**As a** user of the Todo application,
**I want** to see a footer at the bottom of the page with a link to the GitHub repository,
**So that** I can easily access the source code and contribute to or understand the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Footer component created following existing layout patterns
2. [ ] GitHub repository link functional and opens in new tab
3. [ ] Footer integrated into MainLayout component consistently
4. [ ] Responsive design matching Header component patterns
5. [ ] Link includes proper accessibility attributes
6. [ ] No regression in existing layout functionality

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create Footer Component** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` following Header patterns
  - [x] Implement responsive styling using Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Match Header component structure and responsive breakpoints
  - [x] Use Container component for consistent spacing

- [x] **Task 2: Add GitHub Repository Link** (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Add link to https://github.com/barry-napier/todo
  - [x] Configure link to open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
  - [x] Add proper ARIA labels for accessibility
  - [x] Include keyboard navigation support

- [x] **Task 3: Integrate Footer into Layout** (AC: 3, 6)
  - [x] Add Footer to MainLayout component
  - [x] Position footer at bottom of page layout
  - [x] Test existing Header and main content remain unchanged
  - [x] Verify consistent appearance across all pages

## Dev Notes

**Integration Approach:** Add Footer component to MainLayout.tsx similar to Header integration
**Pattern Reference:** Follow Header component in `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
**Key Constraints:** Must maintain existing page layout, use established Tailwind patterns

## Testing

**Unit Tests:** Footer component rendering and link functionality
**Integration Tests:** Footer integration with MainLayout
**Accessibility Tests:** ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
**Regression Tests:** Existing layout components unchanged

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Footer might affect existing page layout or cause visual conflicts
**Mitigation:** Follow exact Header component patterns for styling and responsive breakpoints
**Rollback:** Simple component removal from MainLayout and deletion of Footer.tsx
